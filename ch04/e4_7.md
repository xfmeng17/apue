The kernel has a default setting for the file access permission bits when it
creates a new `core` file. In this example, it was `rw-r--r--`. This default
value may or may not be modified by the `umask` value. The shell also has a
default setting for the file access permission bits when it creates a news file
or redirection. In this example, it was `rw-rw-rw-`, and this value is always
modified by our current `umask`. In this example, our `umask` is 002.
