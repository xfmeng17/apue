We can't use `du`, because it requires either the name of the file, as in\
```
du tempfile
```
or a dirtory name, as in
```
du .
```
But when the `unlink` function returns, the directory entry for `tempfile` is
gone. the `du .` command just shown would not acount for the space still taken
by `tempfile`. We have to use the `df` command in this example to see the
actual amount of free space on the file system.

----------

In my options, `du` is fine as well cause we can use it in up-level directory.
Like I implement `unlink` function in `./unlink/`, so we can `du ./unlink` in
one shell window and run `./unlink/a.out` in `ch04` directory.
