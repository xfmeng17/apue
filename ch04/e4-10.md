We recurively call our function `dopath` after opening a directory with
`opendir`. Assuming that `opendir` uses a single file descriptor, this means
that each time we descend one level, we use another descripor. (We assume
that the) descriptor isn't closed until we're finished with directory and call
`closedir`.) This limits the depth of the file system tree that we can traverse
to the maximum number of open descriptors for the process. Note that the `nftw`
function as specified in the XSI options of the Single UNIX Specification
allows the caller to specify the number of descriptors to use, implying that it
can close and reuse descriptors.
