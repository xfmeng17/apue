The `chroot` function is used by the Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
program to aid in security. Users without accounts on a system (termed
anonymous FTP) are placed in a separate directory, and a `chroot` is done to
that directory. This prevents the user from accessing any file outside the new
root directory.

In addition, `chroot` can be used to build a copy of a file system hierarchy at
a new location and then modify this new copy without changing the original file
system. This could be used, for example, to test the installation of new
software packages.

Only the superuser can execute `chroot` and once you change the root of a
process, it (and all its descendants) can never get back to the origin root.
