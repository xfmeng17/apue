The following technique is use by FreeBSD. The primitive data types that can
appear in multiple headers are defined in the header <machine/_types.h>.

For example:

```
#ifndef _MACHINE_TYPES_H_
#define _MACHINE_TYPES_H_

typedef int __int32_t;
typedef unsigned int __uint32_t;

...
#endif
```

In each of the headers that can define the size_t primitive system data type,
we have the sequence

```
#ifndef _SIZE_T_DECLARED
typedef __size_t size_t;
#define _SIZE_T_DECLARED
#endif
```
This way, the `typedef` for `size_t` is executed only once.
