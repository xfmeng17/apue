This is a common error. The return value from value from `getc` and `getchar`
is an `int` not a `char`. `EOF` is often defined to be -1, so if the system
uses signed characters, the code normally works. But if the system uses
unsigned characters, after the `EOF` returned by `getchar` is stored as an
unsigned character, the character's value no longer equals -1, so the loop
never terminates. The four platforms described in this book all use signed
characters, so the example code works on these platforms
