I think, this is a good exercise with clear explaination.

------

When the program is run interactively, standard output is usually line buffered,
so the actual output occurs when each newline is output. If standard output were
directed to a file, however, it would probably be fully buffered, and the actual
output wouldn't occur until the standard I/O cleanup is perfromed.
