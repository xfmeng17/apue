It appears that the return value from `printf`(the number of characters output)
becames the return value of `main`. To verify this theory, change the length of
the string pointed and see if the new length matches the return value. Note that
not all systems exhibit this property. Also note that if you enable the ISO C
extensions in `gcc`, then the return value is always 0, as required by the
standard.

I always get 0 on tenecnt cloud machine with compile input `gcc xxx -std=c99`. I
should try this on Mac later.
