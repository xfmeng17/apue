The code is incorrect, since it reference the automatic integer `val` through a
pointer after the automatic variable is no longer in existence. Automatic
variables declared after the left brace that starts a compound statement
disappear after the matching right brace.

To be honest, I don't understand this explanation quite well. So I chage some
code in `e7-10.c` to do some test but find no error.

I understand what the end of Section 7.10 try to emphasize, surely need some
time to get what this exercise what to say.

Run `e7-10.c`, the f3() function shows why a function shouldn't return a pointer
to an automatic variable.
