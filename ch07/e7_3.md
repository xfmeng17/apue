On most UNIX systems, there is no way to do this. Copies of `argc` and `argv`
are not kept in global variables like `environ` is.

My tipical solution approach:

1. Go back the whole chapter 7 to do quick summary on each sub-chapter.
2. Force on sub-chapter 7.4, 7.5 and 7.9 because these 3 are related to exercise
7.3.
3. Quickly review functions introduced, find out there is no other way to access
argc/argv.
4. Read solution which may be provided in Appendix C.
