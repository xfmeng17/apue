All disk I/O goes through the kernel's block buffers (also called the kernel's
buffer cache). The exception to this is I/O on a raw disk device, which we
aren't considering. ...... Since the data that we `read` or `write` is buffered
by kernel, the term `Unbuffered I/O` refers to the lack of automatic buffering
in user process with these two functions. Each `read` and `write` invokes a
single system call.
