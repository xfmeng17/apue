Since the shell process their commend line from letf to right, the commend
```
./a.out > outfile > 2>&1
```
first set standard output to `output` file and then `dup` standard output ontu
descriptor 2 (standard error). The result is that standard output and standard
error are set to the same file. Descriptor 1 and 2 are both point to the same
file table entry. With
```
./a.out 2>&1 > outfile
``` 
however, the `dup` is executed first, causing descriptor 2 to be the terminal
(assuming that the command is run interactively). Then the standard output is
redirected to the file `outfile`. The result is that descriptor 1 points to
the file table entry for `outfile`, and descriptor 2 points to the file table
entry for the ternimal.
