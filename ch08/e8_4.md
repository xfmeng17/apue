In Figure 8.13, we have the parent write its output first. When the parent is
done, the child writes its output, but we let the parent terminate. Whether the
parent terminates or whether the child finishes its output first depends on the
kernel's scheduling of the two process (another race condition). When the parent
terminates, the shell starts up the next program, and this next program can
interfere with the output from the previous child.

We can prevent this from happening by not letting the parent terminate until the
child has also finished its output. Replace the code following the `fork` with
the following:

```c
else if (pid == 0) {
	WAIT_PARENT();
	charatatime("output from child\n");
	TELL_PARENT(getppid());
} else {
	charatatime("output from parent\n");
	TELL_CHILD(pid);
	WAIT_CHILD();
}

```

We won't see this happen if we let the child go first, since the shell doesn't
start the next program until the parent terminates.
