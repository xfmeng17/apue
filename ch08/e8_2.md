When `vfork` is called, the parent's stack pointer to the stack frame for the
`f1` function that call `vfork`. Figure C.9 show this `vfork` causes the child
to execute first, and the child returns from `f1`. The child then zeros out the
automatic variable `buf`, setting 1000 bytes of the stack frame to 0. The child
returns from `f2` and then call `_exit`, but the contents of the stack beneath
the stack frame for `main` have been changed. The parent then resumes after the
call to `vfork` and does a return from `f1`. **The return information is ofen
stored in the stack frame, and that information has probably been modified by
the child.** After the parent resumes, what happens with the example depends on
many implementation features of your UNIX system (where in the stack frame the
return information is stored, what information in the stack frame is wiped out
when the automatic variables are modified, and so on). The normal result is a
`core` file, but your result may differ.
