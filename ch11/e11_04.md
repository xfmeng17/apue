It depends on the circumstances. In general, both can be correct, but each
alternative has drawback. In the first sequence, the waiting threads will be
scheduled to run after we call `pthread_cond_broadcast`. If the program is
running on a multiprocessor, some threads will run and immediately block because
we are still holding the mutex (recall that `pthread_cond_wait` returns with the
mutex held). In the second sequence, a running thread can aquire the mutex
between steps 3 and 4, invalidate the condition, and release the mutex. Then,
when we call `pthread_cond_broadcast`, the condition will no longer be true, and
the threads will run needlessly. This is why the awakened threads must recheck
the condition and not assume that it is true merely because `pthread_cond_wait`
returned.
