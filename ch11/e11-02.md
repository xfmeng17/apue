To change the thread ID of a pending job, the read-writer lock must be held in
write mode to prevent anyone from searching the list while ID is being changed.
The problem with the way the interfaces are currently defined is that the ID of
a job can change between the time that the job is found with `job_find` and the
job is removed from the list by calling `job_remove`. This problem can be solved
by embedding a reference count and a mutex inside the job structure and having
`job_find` increment the reference count. The code that changes the ID can then
avoid any job in the list that has a nonzero reference count.
