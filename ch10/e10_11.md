Under Linux/Mac/Solaris, the signal handler for SIGXFSZ is never called. But
`write` returns a count of 24 soon as the file's size reaches 1024 byts (see 
e10-11.log).

When the file's size has reached 1000 bytes under FreeBSD 8.0, the signal handler
is called the next attempt to write 100 bytes, and the `write` call returns -1
with errno set to `EFBIG`("File too big").

On all four platforms, if we attempt an additional `write` at the current file
offset(the end of the file), we will receive `SIGSFSZ` and `write` will fail,
return -1 with errno to `EFBIG`.

------

My:

1. Don't receive `SIGSFSZ`, don't has e10-11-sig.log.
2. Try not use log file, just use print, wht there is no printf???
