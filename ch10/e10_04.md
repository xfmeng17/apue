We again have a race condition, this time between the first call to `alarm` and
the call to `setjmp`. If the process is blocked by the kernel between these two
function calls, the alarm goes off, the signal handler is called, and `longjmp`
is called. But since `setjmp` was never called, the buffer `env_alrm` is not
set. The operation of `longjmp` is undefined if its jump buffer has not been
initialized by `setjmp`.
